# Tic-Tac-Toe

this is an easy project with React.

Following the React tutorial, I built a tic-tac-toe. I redesigned it for greater intuitiveness and made modifications to the gameplay mode.

## Install

`git clone https://github.com/mateus-lopes/tic-tac-toe/`

After, enter at the terminal

`cd tic-tac-toe`

Install to the node dependecies:

`npm install`

Then, init the project:

`npm run start`
