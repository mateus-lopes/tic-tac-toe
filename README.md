# tic-tac-toe with React

this is an easy project with React.

Following the React tutorial, I built a tic-tac-toe game. I redesigned it for greater intuitiveness and made modifications to the gameplay mode.

## Install

`git clone https://github.com/mateus-lopes/tic-tac-toe/`

after, enter at the terminal:

`cd tic-tac-toe`
`npm install`
`npm run start`
